# 🧘 zenta

> **Mindfulness that fits your coding flow**

When your mind wanders while coding, simply return to breath. No tracking, no metrics, no disruption—just pure awareness in your terminal.

**The noticing itself is the practice.** ✨

## 🌊 Beautiful Breathing

```bash
$ breath

       Let's breathe 🌸

    🌬️ Breathe in gently, let your body expand...
                                                
                      ○                         
                    ○ · ○                       
                     ···                        
              ○ · · ·   · · · ○                
                     ···                        
                    ○ · ○                       
                      ·
