# Product Requirements Document: zenta
## 1. Overview
Zenta is a lightweight command-line tool designed for developers and terminal users who want to cultivate mindfulness, reduce distractions, and maintain awareness throughout their workday. Inspired by Zen philosophy and Stoic practice, zenta brings calm, clarity, and presence into the world of deep work.

## 2. Development Philosophy & Rules

**Core Principle: "Do one thing, and do it well"**

Zenta exists solely to help terminal users cultivate mindfulness and awareness. Every feature must serve this single purpose.

### **Unix Philosophy Guidelines:**

**1. Single Purpose Focus**
- Zenta is a mindfulness tool, not a task manager, note-taker, or productivity suite
- Each command should have one clear, well-defined function
- Resist feature creep that dilutes the core purpose

**2. Composability**
- Commands should work well with other Unix tools via pipes and redirection
- `zenta export` should produce clean output suitable for `awk`, `grep`, `sort`
- Logs should be human-readable and processable by standard Unix utilities

**3. Simplicity Over Features**
- Prefer simple, obvious solutions over complex, clever ones
- When choosing between two approaches, pick the one with fewer dependencies
- Configuration should be minimal and have sensible defaults

**4. Text-Based Interface**
- All output should be plain text, suitable for terminal environments
- No GUI components, web interfaces, or rich media
- ASCII-safe output that works in any terminal

**5. Fail Gracefully**
- Handle errors quietly and provide useful error messages
- Degrade gracefully when optional features (sound, notifications) aren't available
- Never crash or produce cryptic error messages

**6. Respect User Environment**
- Don't pollute the user's environment with unnecessary files or processes
- Use standard Unix conventions for configuration and data storage
- Work well with existing terminal workflows and tools

### **Development Rules:**

**Feature Addition Criteria:**
- Does this feature directly support mindfulness/awareness?
- Can this be accomplished better by composing with existing Unix tools?
- Will this add complexity that outweighs the benefit?
- Does this maintain the "lightweight" nature of the tool?

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Functions should do one thing well
- Minimal external dependencies
- Clear, self-documenting code over complex optimizations
- Comprehensive error handling without verbosity

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Adding task management features ("I'll just add a simple todo list...")
- ‚ùå Complex configuration systems with dozens of options
- ‚ùå Web dashboards or GUI components
- ‚ùå Cloud sync, accounts, or external service dependencies
- ‚ùå AI features that require large models or internet connectivity
- ‚ùå Notification systems that are intrusive or attention-grabbing

**Decision Framework:**
When considering any new feature or change, ask:
1. Does this align with helping users be more mindful?
2. Can users achieve this by combining zenta with other Unix tools?
3. Will this make zenta harder to understand or use?
4. Does this respect the "lightweight" promise?

If any answer is "no," reconsider the change.

## 3. Goals
Help users return to the present moment while working in terminal environments.

Reduce unconscious distractions and multitasking habits.

Track self-awareness by logging "moments of drifting."

Provide a simple system for mindful focus cycles (e.g., deep work sessions).

Offer gentle prompts and reflections without intruding or judging.

## 4. Target Users
Developers, sysadmins, or knowledge workers who spend most of their day in the terminal.

Users interested in mindfulness, Zen, Stoicism, or productivity.

People who struggle with digital distractions and want more clarity and self-awareness.

## 5. Core Features

Number of distractions per hour/day/week.

ASCII-based charts (text histogram) showing patterns over time.

Session completion rates and focus duration trends.

Optional period filters: today, week, month, all.

Reflection patterns (e.g., time blocks with most drift).

‚úÖ **zenta start [duration]**
Start a "deep work" session (default 45 minutes, configurable).

Visual timer in terminal with progress indicator.

**zenta config [key] [value]**
Configure timer durations, custom quotes, sound preferences.

Show current configuration when called without parameters.

**zenta history [filter]**
View recent logs with optional filtering by type or date range.

Support for grep-like pattern matching in log messages.

**zenta export [format]**
Export logs in JSON, CSV, or plain text format for external analysis.

Support for date range filtering in exports.

## 7. Non-Goals
Not a full task management system.

Not an AI therapist or chat-based mindfulness app.

No internet dependency ‚Äî runs completely offline.

No cloud storage or user accounts required.
